## Introduction

The modern organization desires efficiency in its working pipeline, and so AGILE boards have risen in the mainstream as a workplace mechanism for helping organizations improve workflow. Board Hub aims to serve as a lightweight and free alternative to software such as Atlassianâ€™s Jira, while still providing all of the necessary and helpful features that people come to expect from a sprint board.
