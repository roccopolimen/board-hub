        <h1>Why Board<span>Hub</span>?</h1>
        <p id="why">We developed BoardHub as a way to address some of our biggest issues with current agile board softwares. Namely, we agreed that story points should be front and center on every card, and we acknowledged that the agile board experience should be minimal to be ultra inclusive. With these goals in mind, we developed BoardHub to be a great lightweight competitor.</p>
